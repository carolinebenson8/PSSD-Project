*describing how to run your code*

The goal of this project is to webscrape Indeed website for a list of job results that match position and location preferences and email them to the user. The user also has the option of selecting whether they'd like to schedule this webscraper to give them a list of jobs the following week as well. All of this can be done on the user website created.

In order to use the following code, one would need to open the **website html name** in their browser. After inputting the information regarding their location, position, scheduling, and emailing preferences and hitting submit, the html will link to the **webscrape.py or email_schedule.py** and run the webscraping.py code using the preferences given. The results from this python file will then be emailed to the user using the **email_schedule.py** file.
