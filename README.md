*describing how to run your code*

The goal of this project is to webscrape Indeed website for a list of job results that match position and location preferences and email them to the user. The user also has the option of selecting whether they'd like to schedule this webscraper to give them a list of jobs the following week as well. All of this can be done on the user website created.
