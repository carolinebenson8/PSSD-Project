        <h1>Automated Job Searcher</h1>
        <h1>By: Caroline Benson, Susanna D'Souza, and Shaoib Rahaman</h1>
        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Big Idea</h1>
        <p>The point of this project is to build an application that can aggregate and return information from across the web to the user. We plan to build a bot that scrubs various job boards based on certain keywords that the user inputs. The bot will log the url, job description, application deadline to generate a report to return the information to the user via email. With this project, the team will explore various automation processes like email and web scraping. At minimum, the program should be able to scrape a job board and return information related to that job to the user by sending an email. Ideally, if successful in all aspects, we would like to polish the interface up and then share the application with CCD for the benefit of the Babson community or create a business out of our service for a small fee from each user.</p>
