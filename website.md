# Project Website

**KEY NOTES**: 
- We have to make this have a good narrative 
- screenshots or pics lets put in a shared drive so that we can easily access to input for website later. for time being label areas where photo will be in italics and bold (** word **)

## THE BIG IDEA - How did we come up with this?
*Quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about. Consider including a narrative or example use case, e.g. via screenshots, video, or story boarding.*
- need to efficiently find jobs, all college seniors trying to find our next stop on journey called life

## User instructions/ReadMe
*Information to help users download, install, and get started running your software.*
- this can be from readme.md that we complete

## Implementation Information
*Code doesn't tell a story by itself. Use more effective methods such as flowcharts and architectural or class diagrams to explain how your code works. You could consider including or linking to snippets of code to highlight a particularly crucial segment.*

- we are making a website for users to interact, but we can address this section as "so that our users understand the code behind the website..."

## Results
*Though the details will be different for each project, show off what your software can do! Screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or other data if appropriate.*

## Project Evolution
  Tell an illustrative story about the process of creating your software, showing how it improved over time. This may draw upon what you learned from the two peer technical reviews. Consider the use of screenshots or other tools to demonstrate how your project evolved.*
